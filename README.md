# Central Idea

1. The idea is to manage sensitive health records using block chain technology. User’s identity is maintained using Aadhaar Number, and provide additional services except just maintaining records.
2. Users (patient) will save their medical history, location and personal details during signup to use the services. Any time when they need medical help they will contact doctor using android application.
3. Radiologist’s report, Doctor’s diagnosis report and prescription is saved in block chain.
4. This prescription can be accessed by the Pharmacist using public key of user thus, preventing unauthorized sale of drugs.
5. Medical insurance company can access user’s data using public key against claim of any insurance money.
6. In case of natural calamity, all the data of users can be accessed on basis location to provide immediate help to all.
7. Medical researchers can access data by using filter of any disease and drugs. In this case personal information like name, age, address, location will not be shared, privacy of user’s data is guaranteed.
8. Blood bank can contact to willing users for donation in case of emergency.
